## Building

Clone the repository: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/DumDum192/Amethyst-Offline.git`

Patch and build the launcher: `./android-build` (Use `android-build.bat` on Windows).

The built APK will be located in `Amethyst-Android/app_pojavlauncher/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.

### iOS
You'll have to use [gpatch](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gpatch) to patch the files manually, then `gmake` to compile the app.
